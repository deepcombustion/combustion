# Intelligent Combustion

The project of `Intelligent Combustion` is to develop algorithms based on deep learning for combustion study. Currently, we have two specific tasks. 

## DeePMR


DeePMR: DeeP Model Reduction, develop DNN-based algorithms for reducing chemical reaction mechanisms.


## DeePCK
DeePCK: DeeP chemical kinetics, develop DNN-based surrogate model to accelerate the simulation of chemical kinetics.

This open project will release various models based on our algorithms.
